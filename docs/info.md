## How it works

This project works by designing an AND gate for A and B and an OR gate C.  I designed a circuit diagram after writing the expression for F=(A*B)+C.

## How to test

I tested to see whether if the output is 1 or 0 by noticing whether if the switch turns on or off.  If the output is 1, then the switch turns on and if the output is 0, the switch turns off.

## External hardware

The hardware that I used for this project is the Wokwi Template.  I also use tiny tapeout to design a circuit for the logic expression that is given to me.
